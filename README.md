This is a remake of an arcade console game that I wrote in C++ for a university project.

To win each level, player has to reach the end of the level, avoiding enemies on the way or solving simple puzzles using movable objects.

The game has 11 levels:
- 4 easy
- 4 medium
- 3 hard

After completing all levels with a given difficulty, you can unlock a new character skin as a reward. 

The project cannot be compiled successfully without all the graphics included in the project which I have not made available in the repository, however you can see the gameplay on my youtube channel.
